## 2025-02-18 - DOM Query Caching in Event Listeners
**Learning:** Found a `mousemove` event listener that was querying the DOM (`querySelectorAll`) on every execution (throttled to 30ms). This creates unnecessary overhead on the main thread during animations.
**Action:** Always cache DOM elements outside of high-frequency event listeners (mousemove, scroll, resize) to prevent repeated DOM traversals.
